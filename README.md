#### Node Open Mining Portal

This portal is an extremely efficient, highly scalable, all-in-one, easy to setup cryptocurrency mining pool written
entirely in Node.js. It contains a stratum poolserver; reward/payment/share processor; and a (*not yet completed*)
responsive user-friendly front-end website featuring mining instructions, in-depth live statistics, and an admin center.


#### 0) Setting up coin daemon
Follow the build/install instructions for your coin daemon. Your coin.conf file should end up looking something like this:
```
daemon=1
rpcuser=litecoinrpc
rpcpassword=securepassword
rpcport=19332
```
For redundancy, its recommended to have at least two daemon instances running in case one drops out-of-sync or offline,
all instances will be polled for block/transaction updates and be used for submitting blocks. Creating a backup daemon
involves spawning a daemon using the `-datadir=/backup` command-line argument which creates a new daemon instance with
it's own config directory and coin.conf file. Learn about the daemon, how to use it and how it works if you want to be
a good pool operator. For starters be sure to read:

#### 1) Downloading & Installing

Clone the repository and run `npm update` for all the dependencies to be installed:

```bash
sudo apt-get install build-essential libsodium-dev libboost-all-dev libgmp3-dev node-gyp libssl-dev -y

sudo apt-get update
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.0/install.sh | bash
source ~/.profile
nvm install 12.22.6
sudo apt-get install redis-server

git clone https://github.com/cbunting99/node-open-mining-portal.git nomp
cd nomp
npm update
```

#### 2) Configuration

##### Portal config
Inside the `config_example.json` file, ensure the default configuration will work for your environment, then copy the file to `config.json`.

##### Coin config
Inside the `coins` directory, ensure a json file exists for your coin. If it does not you will have to create it.
Here is an example of the required fields:
````javascript
{
    "name": "Litecoin",
    "symbol": "ltc",
    "algorithm": "scrypt",

    /* Magic value only required for setting up p2p block notifications. It is found in the daemon
       source code as the pchMessageStart variable.
       For example, litecoin mainnet magic: http://git.io/Bi8YFw
       And for litecoin testnet magic: http://git.io/NXBYJA */
    "peerMagic": "fbc0b6db", //optional
    "peerMagicTestnet": "fcc1b7dc" //optional

    //"txMessages": false, //options - defaults to false

    //"mposDiffMultiplier": 256, //options - only for x11 coins in mpos mode
}
````

For additional documentation how to configure coins and their different algorithms
see [these instructions](//github.com/zone117x/node-stratum-pool#module-usage).


##### Pool config
Take a look at the example json file inside the `pool_configs` directory. Rename it to `yourcoin.json` and change the
example fields to fit your setup.

Description of options:

    /* Block rewards go to the configured pool wallet address to later be paid out to miners,
       except for a percentage that can go to, for examples, pool operator(s) as pool fees or

````

You can create as many of these pool config files as you want (such as one pool per coin you which to operate).
If you are creating multiple pools, ensure that they have unique stratum ports.

For more information on these configuration options see the [pool module documentation](https://github.com/zone117x/node-stratum-pool#module-usage)



##### [Optional, recommended] Setting up blocknotify
1. In `config.json` set the port and password for `blockNotifyListener`
2. In your daemon conf file set the `blocknotify` command to use:
```
node [path to cli.js] [coin name in config] [block hash symbol]
```
Example: inside `dogecoin.conf` add the line
```
blocknotify=node /home/nomp/scripts/cli.js blocknotify dogecoin %s
```

Alternatively, you can use a more efficient block notify script written in pure C. Build and usage instructions
are commented in [scripts/blocknotify.c](scripts/blocknotify.c).


#### 3) Start the portal

```bash
node init.js
```

###### Optional enhancements for your awesome new mining pool server setup:
* Use something like [forever](https://github.com/nodejitsu/forever) to keep the node script running
in case the master process crashes. 
* Use something like [redis-commander](https://github.com/joeferner/redis-commander) to have a nice GUI
for exploring your redis database.
* Use something like [logrotator](http://www.thegeekstuff.com/2010/07/logrotate-examples/) to rotate log 
output from NOMP.
* Use [New Relic](http://newrelic.com/) to monitor your NOMP instance and server performance.


#### Upgrading NOMP
When updating NOMP to the latest code its important to not only `git pull` the latest from this repo, but to also update
the `node-stratum-pool` and `node-multi-hashing` modules, and any config files that may have been changed.
* Inside your NOMP directory (where the init.js script is) do `git pull` to get the latest NOMP code.
* Remove the dependenices by deleting the `node_modules` directory with `rm -r node_modules`.
* Run `npm update` to force updating/reinstalling of the dependencies.
* Compare your `config.json` and `pool_configs/coin.json` configurations to the latest example ones in this repo or the ones in the setup instructions where each config field is explained. You may need to modify or add any new changes.
